##A note to the reader

  I submitted Wrist Message to the App Store in early March, but only to meet Apple’s official rejection. In Apple’s rejection letter, they claimed that Wrist Message “contributes to a lower quality user experience than Apple users expect.” I appealed, but Apple stuck to their decision, this time suggesting “it would be appropriate to remove the full keyboard from your Watch Extension app. Dictation and number pads are acceptable.”

  Stunned, I arranged a phone call with a member of the App Store review board. Over phone, Apple confirmed that an Alphanumeric keyboard on the Apple Watch is unacceptable. Even further, they said that no letter input of any kind would be allowed. This means no buttons, pickers, sliders, images, etc. can involve choosing a letter.

  I finally asked them if my idea for a text messaging keyboard on Apple Watch was even possible. To no surprise, they said it wouldn’t be accepted under their current guidelines. But after looking over their guidelines, I found no mention at all of this imaginary keyboard restriction. When I first started developing Wrist Message, the absence of a restriction made sense to me as I had found many Apple Watch apps that use Alphanumeric input. Unfortunately, Wrist Message was a red flag for Apple, who after contacting me claims that they will adjust their documentation to make keyboard restrictions more clear.

  For now, don’t expect to find a keyboard that sends text messages on the App Store. It was because of Apple’s unfair rejection that I posted Wrist Message on GitHub. Feel free to Fork this project and donate using the button below.
